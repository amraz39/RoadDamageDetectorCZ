# RoadDamageDetectorCZ
Road Damage Dataset contains trained models for CZ road data (SSD MobileNet)

The end-to-end object detection method based on application of deep learning and pre-trained road damage detector from Maeda et al. (2018) 
is presented in the form of SSD Mobile net model. The trained model allows to detect pavement surface damage from images captured with 
mobile phones on primarily Czech local and regional roads.
